# applescript
OSX scripts from automator and script editor

These turn bluetooth and networking on and off.

*moconnect* uses available networking SSIDs to decide which way to automatically connect to networking to provide home/train/work internet access selection.

This also prevents my macbook from auto-connecting to the bluetooth keyboard and trackpad at home unless I want it to.

I bought and installed *Scenario* to easily get a script to run on wake.
